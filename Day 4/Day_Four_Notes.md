# Day 3: Application Release Process

## Roadblocks of Release Process

The Release Process often encounters various roadblocks that can hinder its efficiency and effectiveness. Here are some common roadblocks:

1. Miscommunications and lack of collaborations:

   Developer:
   - Unable to deploy and operate the application.
   - May not consider where the application will be deployed.

   Operations:
   - May lack knowledge of how the application works.

   These miscommunications and lack of collaboration can lead to delays and slow down the release process.

2. Conflicts of interest:

   Developer:
   - Primarily focused on development.
   - Aims to develop new features quickly.

   Operations:
   - Responsible for operations and stability.
   - Prefers quality over fast development to avoid bugs.

   These conflicting interests can create challenges in aligning priorities and goals, affecting the release process.

3. Security:

   Security and operations teams play a crucial role in checking for security vulnerabilities and maintaining the overall security and maintainability of the application. However, this can cause delays in the release process.

4. Testing the application on different levels:

   - Testing the application on different mobile screens, browsers, and platforms (for mobile apps).
   - Performing end-to-end testing.
   - Testing on different environments.
   - Conducting performance testing.

   Manual testing takes time, as automated testing alone is not sufficient, thereby slowing down the process.

5. Manual work(Some of):

   - Operations team manually deploys the application.
   - Manually prepares the deployment environments.
   - Manually configures Jenkins build jobs.
   - Manually configures user access and permissions.
   - Manually manages and updates configuration files.
   - Manually conducts release coordination activities.

   Issues with manual work include slowness, errors, lack of transparency, and difficulties in recovery and replication.

To address these roadblocks and improve the release process, organizations often adopt DevOps practices and principles. DevOps aims to bridge the gap between development and operations, fostering collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to overcome these challenges.
