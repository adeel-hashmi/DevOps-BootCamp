## Application Release Process

The Application Release Process aims to deliver the application to end-users effectively.

| Step               | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Idea               | Generating the concept or idea for the application.               |
| Requirements       | Gathering and defining specific requirements and features.        |
| Code               | Writing and developing the actual code for the application.       |
| Test               | Conducting various tests to ensure the application functions correctly and meets quality standards. |
| Build and Package  | Creating a deployable package that includes all necessary files and dependencies. |
| Deploy             | Installing or deploying the application on the desired infrastructure to make it accessible to end-users. |
| Operate & Monitor  | Continuously operating and monitoring the application for any problems, user issues, and scalability. |

In the **Operate & Monitor** step, the following questions are addressed:

1. Any problems with the application?
2. Are users experiencing any issues?
3. Can the application handle high user load?


## Improvements - After Release

After the initial release of an application, there are several key areas for improvement that can enhance its functionality and user experience. The primary goal is to make these improvements accessible to users immediately.

1. Add New Features:
   - Continuously enhance the application by adding new features and functionalities based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
   - Introduce additional capabilities to meet the changing needs of users and stay competitive in the market.

2. Optimize Performance:
   - Fine-tune the application's performance to ensure it operates efficiently and delivers a smooth user experience.
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks, optimize code, and utilize efficient algorithms or caching mechanisms.

3. Fix Bugs:
   - Address any reported bugs or issues promptly to maintain the application's reliability and stability.
   - Conduct thorough testing and debugging to identify and resolve software defects, ensuring a seamless user experience.

By implementing these improvements, the development team aims to continually enhance the application, meet user expectations, and provide a high-quality user experience. These enhancements are made accessible to users immediately through regular updates and version releases.


## Software Versioning  

Software Versioning is the practice of assigning unique identifiers or labels to different releases of software. It helps track the evolution of software and manage updates, enhancements, and bug fixes.

Key aspects of Software Versioning:

| Version Number | Meaning                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Major Version  | Represents significant releases with major changes or new features.                           |
| Minor Version  | Introduces new features while maintaining backward compatibility.                            |
| Patch Version  | Focuses on bug fixes, security patches, and performance improvements.                        |

Common Versioning Schemes:

| Versioning Scheme  | Format           | Example        |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Semantic Versioning| MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | 1.2.3          |
| Date-based Version | YYYY.MM.DD       | 2023.06.21     |

Versioning allows effective release management, compatibility checks, and helps users understand the significance of software updates.
