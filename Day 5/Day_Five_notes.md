## DevOps

DevOps is an approach that aims to improve collaboration and efficiency between development and operations teams by removing roadblocks and automating processes. It combines cultural philosophies, processes, and tools.

## Seven Principles of DevOps:

## Seven Principles of DevOps:

1. **Eliminate Waste:**
   - Minimize unnecessary work and streamline processes to reduce waste.

2. **Build Quality In:**
   - Make everyone responsible for delivering high-quality software.
   - Detect and prevent defects early in the development process.

3. **Create Knowledge:**
   - Learn from incidents and issues to continuously improve.
   - Establish feedback loops to gather insights and make adjustments.

4. **Defer Commitment:**
   - Make informed decisions at the right time, after considering all factors.
   - Delay decisions to gather more information and avoid premature commitments.

5. **Deliver Fast:**
   - Seek early and frequent feedback for course corrections and improvements.
   - Deliver in smaller batches to enable faster feedback and enhance agility.

6. **Respect People and Culture:**
   - Foster a collaborative and inclusive work environment.
   - Encourage teamwork, trust, and open communication.

7. **Optimize the Whole:**
   - Avoid focusing only on individual parts and optimize the entire system.
   - Strive for improvements that benefit the entire software delivery process.


## DevOps Lifecycle

1. Plan:
   - Define project goals, requirements, and scope.
   - Create a roadmap and prioritize tasks.
   - It's more likely the process of software project management.

2. Code:
   - Write software code based on requirements.
   - Collaborate with team members to develop features.

3. Build:
   - Compile and transform code into an executable format.
   - Package the code for deployment.

4. Test:
   - Verify software functionality and quality.
   - Conduct tests to ensure proper operation.

5. Release:
   - Prepare the software for deployment to production.
   - Coordinate and plan the release process.

6. Deploy:
   - Transfer the software to the production environment.
   - Configure and set up the necessary infrastructure.

7. Operate:
   - Manage and maintain the software in production.
   - Handle user requests and ensure smooth operation.

8. Monitor:
   - Monitor the performance and health of the software.
   - Collect data and identify potential issues.
