## Development

- **What is Development?**
  - Process of creating, designing, and building software solutions to solve problems.

- **Development Types**
  - Front-End Development
  - Back-End Development
  - Full-Stack Development

- **Role of a Developer**
  - Coding
  - Problem-Solving
  - Collaboration (Direct from Client, Team)
  - Testing & Debugging
  - Documentation

## Operations

- **What are Operations?**
  - Activities and processes involved in managing and maintaining applications and infrastructure. It includes tasks such as deploying, monitoring, and supporting to ensure software availability, performance, and reliability.

### Development and Release Management

Deploying applications to various environments:

- Development: Server environment that the developer is using
- Testing: Server environment for the testing team (QA and Security, etc.)
- Staging: Server environment to show to a client/specific group, to get surety from the client
- Production: Server environment for users. Software is properly configured, deployed, and available.

### Infrastructure Management

- Manage the underlying infrastructure required for running applications. Includes managing servers, databases, networks, etc. Configure and maintain the infrastructure performance, etc.

### Monitoring and Performance Management

- Monitor the performance, track key metrics, detect anomalies, and ensure performance expectations are met.

### Incident Management and Troubleshoot

- Investigate and resolve incidents, minimizing the impact on users and restoring service ASAP.

### Security and Compliance

- Ensuring the security and compliance of the software.

### Capacity Planning and Scalability

- Assess the capacity requirements of the application and plan for future growth. Analyze usage patterns, anticipate resource needs, and scale accordingly.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies to protect applications from data loss. Backup data, perform recovery tests, etc.

### Automation and Tooling

- Leverage automation and tooling to streamline operations.

## Problems in Development

Problems faced during development can include:

- Bugs and Errors: Issues in the code that cause the software to malfunction or produce incorrect results.
- Integration Challenges: Difficulties in integrating different modules or components of the software.
- Requirements Misalignment: Miscommunication or discrepancies between the client's requirements and the implemented solution.
- Scalability and Performance: Challenges related to the software's ability to handle increasing amounts of data or users, as well as meeting performance expectations.
- Time and Resource Constraints: Limited time or resources available for development, which may affect the quality or timely completion of the software.

## Problems in Operations

Problems faced in operations can include:

- Downtime and System Outage: Unplanned interruptions or periods of inaccessibility to the software or infrastructure.
- Security Vulnerabilities: Breaches or vulnerabilities in the software or infrastructure that can be exploited by attackers.
- Capacity Planning and Scalability: Difficulties in accurately estimating resource requirements and scaling the infrastructure to meet demand.
- Incident Management and Response: Challenges in effectively managing and responding to incidents, such as system failures or security breaches, to minimize impact and restore service.
